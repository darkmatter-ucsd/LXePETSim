# LXePETSim

A Monte Carlo simulation project for liquid xenon (LXe) PET imaging systems built with [OpenGATE](https://github.com/OpenGATE/opengate).

The image reconstruction is performed with [CASToR](https://castor-project.org/).

This repository contains the full-chain simulation code, formalized data conversion to accommodate the CASToR reconstruction, and visualization tools.
